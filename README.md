# jupyter-on-tap
This is a handy script to download and build both jupyter-base and jupyter and build them for TAP.

To run it with default tags try this:
./build-jupyter.sh
This creates 2 images with tags:
<br>jupyter-base and jupyter</br>

Otherwise pass with some other tags:
./build-jupyter.sh trustedanalytics
when finished you have 2 images:
<br>trustedanalytics/jupyter-base and trustedanalytics/jupyter</br>
